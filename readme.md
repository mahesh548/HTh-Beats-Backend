## üß† What I Learned

This backend project helped me understand how to build a real-world Express server from scratch. I learned how to:

- Set up and manage MongoDB databases using Mongoose

- Implement authentication with JWT, including signing, verifying, and enabling seamless one-time login

- Structure a backend in a clean, modular way ‚Äî separating routes, controllers, and middleware

- Upload user profile pictures to Cloudinary and generate secure, private image URLs

- Handle user input safely with sanitization and validation

- Send OTP emails using Brevo for account verification

- Integrate Google login using OAuth and extract user details from encrypted payloads

- Perform CRUD operations and manage payloads efficiently

- Protect routes using custom middleware and CORS policies

This project played a big role in building my backend fundamentals and preparing me for full-stack development.
